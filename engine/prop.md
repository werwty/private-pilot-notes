Propeller
---------

Fixed Pitch Propeller

  * Spins clockwise (from the pilot's POV)
  * Angle of attack on propeller can't be changed
  * If it's too slow, not enough power
  * If it's too fast, tips of properller might go supersonic
  * Power = Thrust + Angle of attack * v(rot)^2

Get the propeler that meets your needs

  * Should it be better at climbing or at stable flight?
  * Angle of attack should make sense for propeller speed


Constant Speed Propeller

  * can change angle of attack to keep a constant RPM
  * gauge-pressure in manifold
  * speed of engine is controlled by govener
  * expensive as hell
