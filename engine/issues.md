Detonation
----------

When the engine is overheated it explodes without spark plug triggering, too much heat and pressure

Can be caused by Full power + rich mix + carb heat

Leads to RPM drop and vigrations, exhaust temperature rises

Take steps to cool engine immediately

Preignition
-----------

Lighting the fuel too early

Extreme vibration, rpm drop, high temperature

Take steps to cool engine immediately

Causes

  * Magneto malfunction (unlikely) Can test this theory by turning off one magneto
  * Carbon Source in engine that heats and ignites (more likely)


Tank Condensation
-----------------

Valid issue but not a big deal, caused by:

  * gas cap not being straight
  * gasket was broken
  * pump leaking

1 tsp of condensation will make engine sputter for 2-5 seconds, the water will get burned off in normal engine operation
