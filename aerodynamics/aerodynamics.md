## Lift

- bernoulli's principle (speed of gas is increaseed, decrease in pressure at the point of the increase in speed)
    - Shape of the wings, rounded on top (camber), more speed -> decrease in pressure -> lift
    - Increased pressure on bottom of wing, also produce lift

Wing cross section- leading edge, trailing edge, chord, upper camber, lower camber


    
When turning the alierons the drag on the down alieron will be greater, so the airplane yaws towards the opposite side

flaps- increase lift and drag. 


1 kt - 6076 ft
1 statute mile 5280 ft


1kt = 1.15 miles


Airspeed Indicator
VNE Never exceed (red line)
VNO smooth air operations (yellow line)
normal operation (green)
flaps operations (white)

altimeter -> based on barometric pressure
heading indicator -> adjusted to compass every 15 minutes, on level flight, compass to too affected by turning errors. 




4 stroke recirpriocating engine. 
cylinders, pistons, valve.
pisons are linked to crakshaft. each cylinder has 2 sparkplugs. 

1. intake stroke. intake open. 
2. compression. both valves closed
3. power stroke, fuel+air ignighted
4. exhaust stroke. exhaust valve open

every 2 revolutions, all cylinders undergo cycle. more cylinders=smoother engine

exhaust system. cooling -> oil cooling and air through engine. 

2 kinds of oils, mineral oil, ashless dispersant oil-> suspends contaminates, drain out with oil

dual magnito system. engine operates separately from electrical systems

propeller is twisted to produce equal thrust from hub to tip

electrical system

- alternator driven by engine, suppllies power to electrical system and charges battery
- more current at lower engine speed than generators

- master switch
    - alternator and battery.
    - avionics master -> power to radios
    
    magnetos are driven by engine, engine operates fine even if electrical system dies
    
    ammeter-> performance of system, negative _> either overloaded system or disfunctional ammeter, using more power than produced. 


carbureted engines
- fuel primer during engine start, fuel directly into engine cylinders. 
carburetor: venturi causes rapid pressure decrease.
venturi takes fuel and vaporizes it. subsitible to icing. 

carb heat: diverts air from exhaust manifold and increases intake air tempreature
heated intake air less dense, slight power loss
carb ice forms at high moisture and reduced power settings



roger/wilco -> I've recived all your transmission
affermitive -> answer yes to a question. 

Remember the four W's of radio communication: who you are calling, who you are, where you are, and what you want.
The proper way to initiate communication with ATC is to give your location, aircraft type, altitude, what you want to do, and if you have ATIS.


UNICOM is a non-government radio station. UNICOM is an acronym for unified communications, and it's available at most airports which do not have a control tower.
You can request airport advisory information on the UNICOM frequency. Calls to UNICOM are made by using the airport name and the word UNICOM. For example "Clermont UNICOM." You should be aware that a UNICOM station is not always attended.
The generic term for the radio channel to use at airports without an operating control tower is common traffic advisory frequency. The CTAF is indicated on aeronautical charts and other publications At a non-tower field, the four W's are still used on initial contact.

  * Air up to 500ft above wing gets sucked down by the low pressure area generated by wing
 
  
Airfoil

  * Upwash - defliection on oncoming airstream up and over wing
  * Leading edge - part of airfile that meets the airflow first
  * Trailing edge - portion were airflow from top and bottom joins - this can be changed by moving the wing flaps
  * downwash - downward deflection of the airstream

  * camber - curve of the airfoil
  * chordline - leading edge to trailing edge
  * angle of attack - angle between chord line and direction of the relative wind

      * Lift generated is proportional to Angle of attack until we reach the angle of incidence
      * when angle of attack increases airflow on top of the foil accelerates, airflow on the bottom decellerates
          * increase speed of the air on top produces a pressure drop
          * decrease speed of air on bottom produces a pressure increase [see bernoulli principle]
  
Coefficent of lift
  
Stall

  * separation of airflow from the wing's upper surface
  * rapid decrease in lift
  * occurs after the critical angle of attack
  * crit angle is usually 17-18 degrees
  
Wing Design

  * Aspect Ratio
    * length and width relationship
    * span/(avg chord)
    * high aspect ratio = high lifting capacity
      * less drag for same lift
  * Area
    * total surface area, must be sufficent to generate force equivalent to plane weight
  * Planform
    * shape viewed from above
  * Angle of incidence
    * angle of attachemnt of wing to fuseledge
    * angle should make wing root stall before wing tip
      * more control of wing during stall to get you out of a stall
  * Stall strips
    * installed near fuselage
    * disrupt airflow at high angle of attack, causes root to stall before wing
  * Flaps
    * increase the lift effiecnet and decrease stall speed so you can generate lift even at low speeds
  
Boundary layer

  * thin layer of air next to airfoil
  * types:
    * laminar - boredering closely to airfoil, smooth
    * turbulent - separation point on wing
      * stall is when separation point approaches leading edge
  
Clean Configuration
  * landing gear and flaps are up  
Vortex Generator
  * prevents airflow separation, little holes on wing
  
Thrust
  * air through propeller
  * leads to acceleration if thrust>drag
  
Drag

  * Parasite - cause by aircraft surface
    * Form Drag
      * turbulent wake cause by airflow separation aorund surface of structure
      * porportional to size and shape of structure
    * Interference Drag
      * when two airflows of differing speed or direction interact
    * Skin Friction
      * caused by the plane's rough surfaces
    * parasite drag increases proportional to its speed^2
  * Induced Drag
    * caused by the airflow around wing as it creates lift
    * lift is up and to the right, the amount to the right is the induced drag
    * inversely porportional to the speed^2
  * Total Drag
    * Parasite + Induced
    * L/Dmax -> minimum drag, this the best speed to be for most efficent flight power wise
  * Ground Effect
    * Reduction of induced drag by the earth's surface
    * fades at one wingspan above surface
    * allows the airplane to take off at a lower speed
  
Pitch-Power

  * Work = Fd
  * Power = W/t
  * max fuel saving is L/Dmax
  * max range is ?
  
Turning

  * to turn with the same amount of lift we need to increase force
  * if turning with the same speed we need to add poser
  * otherwise speed decreases during turn

  * Adverse yaw during turn
    * cause by rolling the alierons into a turn, angle of attack is different for each wing
    * counteract with rudder
  * during turn need to use rudder and alieron together

  * Slipping turn
    * opposite rudder in direction of turn
  * Skidding turn
    * too much rudder in direction of turn
  * Overbanking
    * turns are more steep than expected
    * outside wing travels faster and generates more lift
    * correct by turning alierons to other side

  * Rate of Turn
  * Radius of Turn


  
Spin

  * Stall with uncoordinated rudder that's not immediately alleviated
  * may survive if above 2000 ft
  * Steps to get out of this:
    1a. flaps up
    1b. throttle back (engine idle)
    1c. alierons neutral
    2. push wheel forward fully
    3. shove opposite rudder forward
    4. gently pull out of dive
  
Climbing flight
  
Gyroscopic precession

  * Force forward when nose points down?
  
Asymmetrical Thrust (p-factor)

  * propeller creates more thrust on downward motion (right) than upwards (left)
  * only applicable with high angle of attack
  * caused by angle of blade
  * Right rudder is needded on ascent
  
Slipstream (spiraliaing)

  * backwards flow of air from propeller
  * casues left yaw
  
Best glide speed - calculated fron L/Dmax  
glide ratio - distance(hor):distance(vert) x/y

Adverse Yaw

  * Yaw caused by rolling the alierons into a turn
  * Root Cause: Angle of attack becomes different for each wing
  
Overbanking

  * turns are more steep than expected
  * outside wing travels faster and causes more lift
  * correct by turining alierons to the other side
  
Rate of turn

  * Time for airplane to turn a specific # of degrees
  * Constant for specified Airspeed and angle of bank
  
Load factor

  * force downward cause by the aparent upward acceleration (G-Force)
  * turning airplanes have higher load factor
  * compensate by increasing angle of attack to deal with the additional load (if we want to maintain altitude)
  * Accelerated stalls airspeed > 1G stall speed
  * Limit Load factor - max Gs an airplane can withstand
