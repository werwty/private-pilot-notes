Parts of an airplane
----------------------
  
* Powerplant  
* Wings  
* Elevator -> pitch  
* Alierons -> yaw  
* Empennage  
* Vert STab  
* Rudders -> roll  
* Landing Gear  
* Fuselage
  * Types
    * Open Truss - visible struts and bracing- "open"
    * Semimoncoque - stretched skin (most aircrafts today)
    * monocoque - skin carries all flight load, any deformation in surface can cause collapse

Aerodynamics
-------------

Lift

  * Air up to 500ft above wing gets sucked down by the low pressure area generated by wing
  
Airfoil

  * Upwash - defliection on oncoming airstream up and over wing
  * Leading edge - part of airfile that meets the airflow first
  * Trailing edge - portion were airflow from top and bottom joins - this can be changed by moving the wing flaps
  * downwash - downward deflection of the airstream

  * camber - curve of the airfoil
  * chordline - leading edge to trailing edge
  * angle of attack - angle between chord line and direction of the relative wind

      * Lift generated is proportional to Angle of attack until we reach the angle of incidence
      * when angle of attack increases airflow on top of the foil accelerates, airflow on the bottom decellerates
          * increase speed of the air on top produces a pressure drop
          * decrease speed of air on bottom produces a pressure increase [see bernoulli principle]
  
Coefficent of lift
  
Stall

  * separation of airflow from the wing's upper surface
  * rapid decrease in lift
  * occurs after the critical angle of attack
  * crit angle is usually 17-18 degrees
  
Wing Design

  * Aspect Ratio
    * length and width relationship
    * span/(avg chord)
    * high aspect ratio = high lifting capacity
      * less drag for same lift
  * Area
    * total surface area, must be sufficent to generate force equivalent to plane weight
  * Planform
    * shape viewed from above
  * Angle of incidence
    * angle of attachemnt of wing to fuseledge
    * angle should make wing root stall before wing tip
      * more control of wing during stall to get you out of a stall
  * Stall strips
    * installed near fuselage
    * disrupt airflow at high angle of attack, causes root to stall before wing
  * Flaps
    * increase the lift effiecnet and decrease stall speed so you can generate lift even at low speeds
  
Boundary layer

  * thin layer of air next to airfoil
  * types:
    * laminar - boredering closely to airfoil, smooth
    * turbulent - separation point on wing
      * stall is when separation point approaches leading edge
  
Clean Configuration
  * landing gear and flaps are up  
Vortex Generator
  * prevents airflow separation, little holes on wing
  
Thrust
  * air through propeller
  * leads to acceleration if thrust>drag
  
Drag

  * Parasite - cause by aircraft surface
    * Form Drag
      * turbulent wake cause by airflow separation aorund surface of structure
      * porportional to size and shape of structure
    * Interference Drag
      * when two airflows of differing speed or direction interact
    * Skin Friction
      * caused by the plane's rough surfaces
    * parasite drag increases proportional to its speed^2
  * Induced Drag
    * caused by the airflow around wing as it creates lift
    * lift is up and to the right, the amount to the right is the induced drag
    * inversely porportional to the speed^2
  * Total Drag
    * Parasite + Induced
    * L/Dmax -> minimum drag, this the best speed to be for most efficent flight power wise
  * Ground Effect
    * Reduction of induced drag by the earth's surface
    * fades at one wingspan above surface
    * allows the airplane to take off at a lower speed
  
Pitch-Power

  * Work = Fd
  * Power = W/t
  * max fuel saving is L/Dmax
  * max range is ?
  
Turning

  * to turn with the same amount of lift we need to increase force
  * if turning with the same speed we need to add poser
  * otherwise speed decreases during turn

  * Adverse yaw during turn
    * cause by rolling the alierons into a turn, angle of attack is different for each wing
    * counteract with rudder
  * during turn need to use rudder and alieron together

  * Slipping turn
    * opposite rudder in direction of turn
  * Skidding turn
    * too much rudder in direction of turn
  * Overbanking
    * turns are more steep than expected
    * outside wing travels faster and generates more lift
    * correct by turning alierons to other side

  * Rate of Turn
  * Radius of Turn


  
Spin

  * Stall with uncoordinated rudder that's not immediately alleviated
  * may survive if above 2000 ft
  * Steps to get out of this:
    1a. flaps up
    1b. throttle back (engine idle)
    1c. alierons neutral
    2. push wheel forward fully
    3. shove opposite rudder forward
    4. gently pull out of dive
  
Climbing flight
  
Gyroscopic precession

  * Force forward when nose points down?
  
Asymmetrical Thrust (p-factor)

  * propeller creates more thrust on downward motion (right) than upwards (left)
  * only applicable with high angle of attack
  * caused by angle of blade
  * Right rudder is needded on ascent
  
Slipstream (spiraliaing)

  * backwards flow of air from propeller
  * casues left yaw
  
Best glide speed - calculated fron L/Dmax  
glide ratio - distance(hor):distance(vert) x/y

Adverse Yaw

  * Yaw caused by rolling the alierons into a turn
  * Root Cause: Angle of attack becomes different for each wing
  
Overbanking

  * turns are more steep than expected
  * outside wing travels faster and causes more lift
  * correct by turining alierons to the other side
  
Rate of turn

  * Time for airplane to turn a specific # of degrees
  * Constant for specified Airspeed and angle of bank
  
Load factor

  * force downward cause by the aparent upward acceleration (G-Force)
  * turning airplanes have higher load factor
  * compensate by increasing angle of attack to deal with the additional load (if we want to maintain altitude)
  * Accelerated stalls airspeed > 1G stall speed
  * Limit Load factor - max Gs an airplane can withstand
