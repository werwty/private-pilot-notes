Layered clouds are called stratus, and indicate stable conditions â€“ expect a relatively smooth flight, with fair to poor visibility. If there is precipitation, it's usually widespread, light to moderate rain or snow. Layer clouds found on the surface are classified as fog.

stratus - layered, smooth flight, fair to poor visibility

cumulus - verticle development  bumpy flight ood visibility, rain heavy and localized, air is unstable

verticle distrubances -> convective, carry dusy away from ground. good visibility 

inversion - tempreature increases with altitude, stable layer of atomsphere.
surface and low level inversion -> low visibility, traps fog 


Relative humidity is the relationship between the amount of water vapor in the air in comparison to the maximum amount that could exist at that temperature.

dew point-> relative humidity reaches 100%



Radiation fog, called ground fog, forms on a clear, cold night when the surface of the earth is cooled by radiation until the temperature of the air near the surface is below initial dew point. Cooling of the air causes fog to form. Light winds deepen the fog while stronger winds tend to disperse it.


Advection fog, sometimes called sea fog, occurs mostly along coasts and is caused by wind transporting warm moist air to a colder surface. Winter advection fog, caused by strong southerly winds off the Gulf of Mexico, may cover the eastern U.S â€“ as far north as the Great Lakes. Light to moderate winds deepen the fog while strong winds lift the fog forming low stratus clouds.
Upslope fog is caused by wind forcing moist stable air up a sloping land surface. Moist unstable air forced upward by mountain lift, called orographic lift, will form cumulus clouds instead of fog.
Precipitation induced fog is caused by the evaporation of rain or drizzle. It can form rapidly over a large area and persist for an extended period.
Ice fog forms in conditions similar to the conditions favorable for radiation fog, with the difference being that extremely cold temperatures exist.


Sea level atomospheric pressure -> 14.7 lbs/in2

standard daytum -> starting point for calculations
standard day -> 50 degrees f, 29.92 in of mercury.

temp and pressure decrease as you go up into the atomsphere. 1 in HG -> 1000 ft
